# Maze-Solving-Using-Bidirectional-BFS
Bidirectional BFS in this code is implemented to find the shortest path in a maze by searching simultaneously from both the entrance and the exit. The algorithm initializes two queues, ‘entranceQueue’ and ‘exitQueue’, and two sets, ‘visitedEntrances’ and ‘visitedExits’, starting from (0,0) and (rows-1, columns-1) respectively. The search alternates between expanding nodes from these two queues. For each node processed, the algorithm checks its neighbors (down and right for entrance, up and left for exit) and adds valid moves to the respective queue if they haven't been visited yet. If a node from one queue is found in the opposite visited set, it indicates a path has been found. The algorithm then backtracks from the meeting point to mark the path in the matrix as '2'. This bidirectional approach reduces the search space, leading to faster convergence by meeting in the middle. If a path is found, it is written to an output file; otherwise, a message indicating no path is found is displayed. Additionally, edge cases such as invalid file uploads and errors in file writing are handled gracefully to ensure robustness. The algorithm ensures no revisits by checking against visited nodes, making the search efficient and preventing infinite loops.
